## This repository is no longer the home of the official jQuery Globalization plugin, which is now at [https://github.com/jquery/jquery-global](https://github.com/jquery/jquery-global).

The code source has been removed in the latest commit, to prevent confusion, leaving just this readme.

### History of this repository
This repository was originally created here, but was later adopted by jQuery as an _Official jQuery Plugin_.

See <a href="http://www.borismoore.com/2010/10/jquery-templates-is-now-official-jquery.html">http://www.borismoore.com/2010/10/jquery-templates-is-now-official-jquery.html</a> for more background.

The code that was in this repository was therefore pulled into the main <a href="https://github.com/jquery/jquery-global">jquery/jquery-global</a> repository, which is now the <strong>official _JQuery Global_ plugin repository</strong>. (The pulled code is the Beta1 release of the official plugin).
